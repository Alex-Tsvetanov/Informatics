Designating each vertex or set of connected vertices a "component", pseudocode for Bor≈Øvka's algorithm is:
<code><pre>
	Input: A connected graph G whose edges have distinct weights 
	Initialize a forest T to be a set of one-vertex trees, one for each vertex of the graph.
	While T has more than one component:
		For each component C of T:
			Begin with an empty set of edges S
			For each vertex v in C:
				Find the cheapest edge from v to a vertex outside of C, and add it to S
				Add the cheapest edge in S to T
		Combine trees connected by edges to form bigger components
	Output: T is the minimum spanning tree of G.
</pre></code>
As in Kruskal's algorithm, tracking components of T can be done efficiently using a disjoint-set data structure. In graphs where edges have identical weights, edges with equal weights can be ordered based on the lexicographic order of their endpoints.
